Custom-Loader
=============
This is a small loader that I wrote which outlines how can editing stack values on the fly be automated.

To run the project you would first need to compile print2.cpp
(I use codeblocks 12.11 which comes with a gcc preinstalled)
Then you need to compile loader.cpp. On running loader.cpp a myf.exe file is created. 
This is basically the exact copy of print2.exe and is played around with.
